1. Gym
I enjoy going to the gym almost everyday. The feeling of working out your body is one of the best to experience. I just got into this hobby 4 months ago but I do not regret any part of it.

2. Video Games
In my free time I enjoy playing games with my friends. It helps me relax and forget about lifes problems for a while. Spending time with friends is also very important to me.
