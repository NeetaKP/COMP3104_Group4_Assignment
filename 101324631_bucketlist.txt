1. Go to Japan
Ever since I got into anime I have always wanted to visit japan. I have watched so many japan videos that showcase the beautiful views and spanning cityscapes. I hope to try all the different foods that japan has to offer as well as learn all about the culture.

2. Learn Guitar
I already know how to play the ukelele, but the guitar is much more difficult. The guitar is one of those instruments that sound and look cool when you play it.

3. Get a job at a big game company
Ever since getting into computer programming, I have always wanted to be apart of creating games. It would be a dream to work at a company as big as Sony or Microsoft.

4. Listening to podcasts
I recently got into listening to different types of podcasts. From fitness podcasts to gaming podcasts they all interest me.

5. Ride in a helicopter
This may seem random, but being able to see the world from a height a little lower than a plane would be a great experience to have. It would feel more personal and unique for sure.
