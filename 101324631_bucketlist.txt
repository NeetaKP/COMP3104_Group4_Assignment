1. Go to Japan
Ever since I got into anime I have always wanted to visit japan. I have watched so many japan videos that showcase the beautiful views and spanning cityscapes. I hope to try all the different foods that japan has to offer as well as learn all about the culture.

2. Learn Guitar
I already know how to play the ukelele, but the guitar is much more difficult. The guitar is one of those instruments that sound and look cool when you play it.
