1. Lord of the Rings Series
I enjoyed all the different adventures our heroes went through to finally bring the ring to mount doom. My favorite character in this movie is Gandalf.

2. Spirited Away
This animated movie is very unique in its art style. I liked how abstract and fantasy like it was.

3. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
As a marvel fan, I was super excited when this movie came out. I loved how they developed Miles Morales into Spider-Man and how vibrant all the colors were.

4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
This movie was on my radar as soon as the first one ended. The addition of Gwen Stacy as another main character was a great development for Miles Morales as a Spider-Man. The soundtrack in this movie was also amazing.
